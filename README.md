This is a webapp I developed for my highschool for keeping track of attendance. 

The school had a block schedule on Wednesdays and Thursdays, during which their attendance application was unable to effectively keep track of students. Thus, the school resorted to a pen and paper system of attendance, which was difficult and time-consuming to manage as the school had almost 4000 students.

My application allowed teachers to take attendendence using a 1-click system. The webapp contained a database of student information and automated the process of sending the attendance information to admin.
